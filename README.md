# SEO Audit Tool

A comprehensive SEO and technical audit tool designed for digital agencies and developers. Because "attention is all you need" in AI, but apparently you also need proper schema markup, robots.txt, and the ability to explain to clients why their bounce rate is higher than their conversion rate.

## Features

- **Single Page Analysis**: Complete SEO, accessibility, and performance audit (the works)
- **Sitemap Crawling**: Analyze entire websites (up to 200 pages, because who has time for more?)
- **Schema Validation**: Automatic content type detection and schema recommendations
- **AI Readiness**: Optimization for Google AI Overviews and LLM crawlers (future-proofing included)
- **Fix Priorities**: Actionable task list with effort estimates and impact analysis (no more "fix everything" requests)
- **Multiple Export Formats**: CSV reports, action plans, and client-ready summaries

### AI Optimization Features ‚ú®

Because the robots are taking over search results, might as well help them understand your content:

- **üèÜ AI Surfaces Readiness Score**: Comprehensive 0-100 scoring system with 6 weighted sub-metrics for AI optimization
- **Google AI Overview Optimization**: Featured snippet potential, entity recognition, Q&A structure analysis
- **Content Structure Analysis**: AI-readable hierarchy, optimal paragraph lengths, content completeness scoring

3. Each task includes effort estimate and business impact (so you can prioritize properly)
4. Export as CSV for client reports or Markdown for your development backlog

### Adding New Audit Tests

1. Create test function in `server.js`
2. Add to main audit pipeline
3. Update frontend display logic
4. Include in fix priorities system

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Puppeteer Download Fails**
```bash
# Skip download and use system Chrome
PUPPETEER_SKIP_DOWNLOAD=1 npm install
# Set Chrome path
export PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH="/usr/bin/google-chrome"
```

**Port Already in Use**
```bash
PORT=3002 npm start
```

**Memory Issues with Large Sites**
- Reduce `SITEMAP_MAX_URLS`
- Increase Node.js memory: `node --max-old-space-size=4096 server.js`

**Lighthouse Timeouts**
- Disable Lighthouse for problematic sites
- Check network connectivity and site response times

### Performance Tips

- Use environment variables for production
- Enable caching for repeated audits
- Set appropriate `SITEMAP_MAX_URLS` for your use case
- Consider running multiple instances for high-volume usage
